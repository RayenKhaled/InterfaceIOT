MY application provides real-time monitoring of water quality in reverse osmosis machines using data from a Firebase database.
The application retrieves values such as
/////
pH level
total dissolved solids (TDS)
temperature
pressure
other...
/////
With the information retrieved from the database, the application performs calculations to determine the current state of the machine.
The application uses these values to detect potential issues and alerts users if any anomalies are detected.

The dashboard displays a range of information about the machine, including the current state, 
water quality metrics, and historical data. Users can monitor the performance of their machines, 
track changes in water quality over time, and identify any issues that may arise. Additionally, 
the dashboard includes a visual representation of the water quality metrics, making it easy to understand the data at a glance.
